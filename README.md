# Melody-Extraction
This is a project I worked on during my RA internship in Academia Sinica. I used the lpd dataset: https://salu133445.github.io/lakh-pianoroll-dataset/ to train and test my work.
## SPRING Algorithm Implementation
The SPRING Algorithm that I used in the Vocal.ipynb programme is an adjusted version of the DTW algorithm that aims to mark the matching subsequences in 2 temporal data. The algorithm is proposed by Sakurai et al.
